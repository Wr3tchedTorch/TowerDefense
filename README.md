**Genre:** Tower Defense, Clicker, Rogue Like

## Overview

In this game, the player makes his own money by clicking on a golden block. In the beginning the player is given 5 sec to click as hard as he can until enemies start coming in his direction. To protect himself, he can use money to build and upgrade towers. 

Some towers are stronger against certain types of enemies. The towers have item slots that can be filled to gain specific attributes, such as high bullet pen, poison bullets, fire bullets, etc.

## Roguelike approach

By the end of each turn the player can choose a card thatâ€™ll give him something useful, such as a bullet upgrade component (poison bullet, fire bullet, penetration bullet, etc) that he can attach to any tower, more money, 10% attack speed to all gunner towers, 25% more income by clicks, etc.
